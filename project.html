        <h1>The curse</h1>
        <h2>Original country:Middle Asia</h2>
        <p>The tulip flower is known as the flower of love and fidelity because of the Iranian legend that says that there was a young man named “Farhard” who received news of his lover called “Shirin.”His intense sadness and love for her prompted him to throw himself from the top of a mountain with his horse, and he bled profusely and a place bloomed. Every drop of his blood is a tulip.</p>
